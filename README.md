# covid-plots

Here I use some `dplyr` and `ggplot` to explore and visualize
the covid data from JHU ([link](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)).

## Notes

- I cloned the `COVID-19` repo to a level higher than the `covid-plots` repo.
- The location `data` points to `COVID-19/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series`. 
- I am only using and plotting the time series data from the US (confirmed and deaths).

## TODO

- add plots/analysis of world data
