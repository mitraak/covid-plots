# covid-plots

Here I use some `dplyr` and `ggplot` to explore and visualize
the covid data from JHU ([link](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)).

I cloned the above repo to a level higher than the `covid-plots` repo,
and hard-coded the links to the data. I am only using and plotting the 
time series data from the US (confirmed and deaths).
